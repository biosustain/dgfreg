  abstract = {The laws of thermodynamics constrain the action of biochemical systems. However, thermodynamic data on biochemical compounds can be difficult to find and is cumbersome to perform calculations with manually. Even simple thermodynamic questions like `how much Gibbs energy is released by ATP hydrolysis at pH 5?' are complicated excessively by the search for accurate data. To address this problem, eQuilibrator couples a comprehensive and accurate database of thermodynamic properties of biochemical compounds and reactions with a simple and powerful online search and calculation interface. The web interface to eQuilibrator (http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il) enables easy calculation of Gibbs energies of compounds and reactions given arbitrary pH, ionic strength and metabolite concentrations. The eQuilibrator code is open-source and all thermodynamic source data are freely downloadable in standard formats. Here we describe the database characteristics and implementation and demonstrate its use.},

  abstract = {eQuilibrator (equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il) is a calculator for biochemical equilibrium constants and Gibbs free energies, originally designed as a web-based interface. While the website now counts \$\{\textbackslash sim\}1000\$ distinct monthly users, its design could not accommodate larger compound databases and it lacked an application programming interface (API) for integration in other tools developed by the systems biology community. Here, we report a new python-based package for eQuilibrator, that comes with many new features such as a 50-fold larger compound database, the ability to add novel compound structures, improvements in speed and memory use, and correction for Mg2+ ion concentrations. Moreover, it adds the ability to compute the covariance matrix of the uncertainty between estimates, for which we show the advantages and describe the application in metabolic modeling. We foresee that these improvements will make thermodynamic modeling more accessible and facilitate the integration of eQuilibrator into other software platforms.},

  abstract = {Standard Gibbs energies of reactions are increasingly being used in metabolic modeling for applying thermodynamic constraints on reaction rates, metabolite concentrations and kinetic parameters. The increasing scope and diversity of metabolic models has led scientists to look for genome-scale solutions that can estimate the standard Gibbs energy of all the reactions in metabolism. Group contribution methods greatly increase coverage, albeit at the price of decreased precision. We present here a way to combine the estimations of group contribution with the more accurate reactant contributions by decomposing each reaction into two parts and applying one of the methods on each of them. This method gives priority to the reactant contributions over group contributions while guaranteeing that all estimations will be consistent, i.e. will not violate the first law of thermodynamics. We show that there is a significant increase in the accuracy of our estimations compared to standard group contribution. Specifically, our cross-validation results show an 80\% reduction in the median absolute residual for reactions that can be derived by reactant contributions only. We provide the full framework and source code for deriving estimates of standard reaction Gibbs energy, as well as confidence intervals, and believe this will facilitate the wide use of thermodynamic data for a better understanding of metabolism.},

  abstract = {Reaction equilibrium constants (Keqs) are key parameters that impose thermodynamic constraints on the function of a metabolic network. An important approach for Keq estimation is the group contribution method, which utilizes chemical moiety-based estimates of compound formation energies. In this Opinion, we delineate a number of current challenges with the group contribution method, specifically: (i) problems related to the completeness and quality of data necessary for reliable estimation; and (ii) inadequacies of the method to represent the physical properties of compounds. We then highlight a number of promising approaches to deal with the limitations of group contribution methods. Further advancements should lead to more accurate prediction of equilibrium constants and a better representation of cellular function under biophysical constraints.},

  abstract = {Biochemical network reconstructions have become popular tools in systems biology. Metabolicnetwork reconstructions are biochemically, genetically, and genomically (BiGG) structured databases of biochemical reactions and metabolites. They contain information such as exact reaction stoichiometry, reaction reversibility, and the relationships between genes, proteins, and reactions. Network reconstructions have been used extensively to study the phenotypic behavior of wild-type and mutant stains under a variety of conditions, linking genotypes with phenotypes. Such phenotypic simulations have allowed for the prediction of growth after genetic manipulations, prediction of growth phenotypes after adaptive evolution, and prediction of essential genes. Additionally, because network reconstructions are organism specific, they can be used to understand differences between organisms of species in a functional context.There are different types of reconstructions representing various types of biological networks (metabolic, regulatory, transcription/translation). This chapter serves as an introduction to metabolic and regulatory network reconstructions and models and gives a complete description of the core Escherichia coli metabolic model. This model can be analyzed in any computational format (such as MATLAB or Mathematica) based on the information given in this chapter. The core E. coli model is a small-scale model that can be used for educational purposes. It is meant to be used by senior undergraduate and first-year graduate students learning about constraint-based modeling and systems biology. This model has enough reactions and pathways to enable interesting and insightful calculations, but it is also simple enough that the results of such calculations can be understoodeasily.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo is a key computational tool in Bayesian statistics, but it can be challenging to monitor the convergence of an iterative stochastic algorithm. In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic R\textasciicircum{} of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws. Traditional R\textasciicircum{} will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},
